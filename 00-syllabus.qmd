## Description

-   This course is for students who want to learn about the relationships between climate change and Earth's most powerful storms through the analysis and modeling of data

-   All course materials are available on GitHub {{< fa brands github >}} <https://github.com/jelsner/CS-2023>

## Expected learning outcomes

-   On successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1.  Appraise the fundamental concepts, principles, theories, and terminology used in discussing the relationships between climate change and storminess
2.  Apply the principles of data science to make effective graphs, tables and inferences
3.  Contribute to contemporary scientific debates using empirical evidence

## Materials and class meetings

-   Computer and access to the internet
-   Course slides are available through GitHub <https://github.com/jelsner/CS-2023>
-   No textbook is required

## Class meetings

-   Each class period I will prepare a small set of slides using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Quarto is an open-source scientific publishing system

-   Quarto allows me to weave together narrative text and code to produce formatted output. Quarto documents are reproducible

-   The slides (`_.qmd` files) are available on GitHub. The slide files are opened using an application called RStudio

-   In-person lessons will be held in this room (Bellamy 208)

## Grading

-   You are responsible for:

1.  Reading, watching, and running code in the lesson slides. You can do this during class or outside the classroom. I will not take attendance
2.  Completing and returning the in-class labs on time

-   Grades are determined by how well you do on the in-class labs using the following standard

## Standard

-   A: Outstanding: few, in any, errors/omissions
-   B: Good: only minor errors/omissions
-   C: Satisfactory: minor omissions, at least one major error/omission
-   D: Poor: several major errors/omissions
-   F: Fail: many major errors/omissions

I will use the +/- system
