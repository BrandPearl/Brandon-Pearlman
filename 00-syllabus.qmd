## GEO4251: Climate Change & Storms

* Understanding our changing climate & storminess through analysis of data

* If the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil can set off a tornado in Texas why can't a single person make a difference across the globe?

* Science is a way of discovering

## Description

This course is for students who want to learn more about the relationships between climate change and Earth's most powerful storms through the analysis and modeling of data

All the course slides are available on GitHub {{< fa brands github >}}  <https://github.com/jelsner/CS-2023>

## Expected learning outcomes

On successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. Appraise the fundamental concepts, principles, theories, and terminology used in discussing the relationships between climate change and storminess
2. Apply the principles of data science to make effective graphs, tables and inferences
3. Contribute to contemporary scientific debates with empirical evidence

## Materials and class meetings

-   Computer and access to the internet
-   Course slides are available through GitHub  <https://github.com/jelsner/CS-2023>
-   No textbook is required

## Class meetings

Each class period I will prepare a small set of slides using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Quarto is an open-source scientific publishing system

Quarto allows me to weave together narrative text and code to produce formatted output. Quarto documents are reproducible

The slides (`_.qmd` files) are available on GitHub. The slide files are opened using an application called RStudio

In-person lessons will be held in this room (Bellamy 208)

## Grading

You are responsible for:

1.  Reading, watching, and running code in the lesson slides. You can do this during class  or outside the classroom. I will not take attendance
2.  Completing and returning the in-class labs on time

Grades are determined by how well you do on the in-class labs using the following standard

## Standard

-   A: Outstanding: few, in any, errors/omissions
-   B: Good: only minor errors/omissions
-   C: Satisfactory: minor omissions, at least one major error/omission
-   D: Poor: several major errors/omissions
-   F: Fail: many major errors/omissions

I will use the +/- system.

## Getting ready

-   Getting set up
-   RStudio & R
-   Using R
-   Making graphs
-   Trends

## Climate data

-   Weather and climate data
-   Increasing greenhouse gases
-   Sea ice and sea levels
-   Temperatures: ocean, land, global vs local
-   Proxy data: ice cores, over-wash sediment deposits, tree rings
-   Humidity
-   Storms: hurricanes, tornadoes
-   Modes of variability

## Analyzing climate data

-   Statistics vs observations
-   Detection vs attribution
-   Frequency vs intensity

## Modeling climate data

-   Uncertainty: classical vs Bayesian
-   Space vs time
-   Artificial intelligence and machine learning

## Climate models

-   Prediction vs predictability
-   Prediction vs explanation (etiology, causes)
-   Prediction markets

## Our warming planet
