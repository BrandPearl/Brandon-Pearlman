## Getting set up continued

Assuming you have Quarto, R, and RStudio installed on your computer AND you have a GitHub account with a copy of my repository <https://github.com/jelsner/CCS-2023> (see `01-getting-setup.qmd` through step 6)

## Do this 7th

-   Open RStudio
-   Under `File` > `New Project` select `Version Control`
-   Select `Git`
-   Repository URL: `https://github.com/[your GitHub username]/CCS-2023-[your name].git`

##

-   Project directory name: `CCS-2023-[your name]`
-   Create a project as a directory of: e.g. `Browse to Desktop`
-   Select `Create Project`. You should see a `Git` tab in one of the windows (upper right)
-   Click on the `02-Quarto-RStudio-R.qmd`
-   Select `Render` (next to the blue arrow) to generate the slide deck for today's lesson

## At the start of each class

-   Go to `https://github.com/[your GitHub username]`
-   Select the `Sync fork` button under the green `Code` button 
![](figures/Syncfork.png)

##

-   Click `Update branch`
-   Open the Folder `CCS-2023-[your name]` on your Desktop
-   Open the file `CCS-2023.Rproj`
-   Under the `Git` tab select blue arrow (pointing down) to `Pull` down changes from your GitHub repository
-   Select the `XX-name-of-lesson.qmd` file
-   Select `Render` to generate the slide deck

## Don't push!

-   You can add notes to the lesson files (`_.qmd`) on your computer
-   You can add new files to your local directory
-   These changes stay on your computer only
-   Don't push them to your GitHub repository!

## Don't panic!

If you can't get things to work with your GitHub repository and/or your RStudio does not recognize git then you can download my entire class repository all at once

-   Go to <https://github.com/jelsner/CCS-2023>
-   Select the Green code button and scroll to `Download ZIP`
-   Unzip the file on your Desktop
-   From the `CCS-2023-main` folder open the `CCS-2023.Rproj` file
-   Select the `XX-name-of-lesson.qmd` file
-   Select `Render` to generate the slide deck

## Getting individual files off GitHub

To keep the `CCS-2023-main` folder up to date you can get the individual lesson file off GitHub

-   Go to <https://github.com/jelsner/CCS-2023>
-   Select the individual lesson file (`XX-name-of-lesson.qmd`)
-   Select the Raw tab then Save page as
-   Move that file to your folder `CCS-2023-main`

## What is Quarto?

-   Quarto is an open-source publishing system built on a document converter (Pandoc). When you click on the file `02-Quarto-RStudio-R.qmd` you should see this ![](figures/RStudio.png){width="500"}
-   Quarto files begin with a YAML between the two sets of lines that have three dashes

## What is RStudio?

-   RStudio is an *integrated development environment* (IDE). An IDE is like a toolbox. An organized collection of tools for developing content, text, images, video, and code
-   Four panels: Editor, Environment/History, Console/Terminal, Files etc
-   The Quarto markdown source file is shown in the Editor panel. Click on the `Render` button to generate the slides for today's lesson

## What is R?

If Quarto is a car, then RStudio is the dashboard, and R is the engine

![Analogy of difference between R and RStudio](figures/EngineDashboard.png){width="5000"}

## 

-   More precisely, {{< fa brands r-project >}} is a programming language that runs code
-   In a car you have access to a speedometer, rear view mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving easier. RStudio makes using {{< fa brands r-project >}} easier as well
-   In a Quarto markdown file you include code like this
```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

-   When you click the **Render** button a presentation is generated that includes content and the output of embedded code

## Getting to know RStudio and R

![RStudio](figures/RStudio.png){width="800"}
-   4 panels each with various options. Some of the things I find useful

## Create a PDF

-   To create a PDF you will need to install LaTeX on your computer
-   You can install a version of LaTex (TinyTex) with the following command in the Terminal window of RStudio
-   Click on the `Terminal` tab and then type

`quarto install tool tinytex`
