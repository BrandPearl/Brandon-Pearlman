## What is Quarto? {.smaller}

-   Quarto is an open-source publishing system built on a document converter (Pandoc). When you click on the file `02-Quarto-RStudio-R.qmd` you should see this ![](figures/RStudio.png){width="500"}
-   Quarto files begin with a YAML between the two sets of lines that have three dashes

## What is RStudio?

-   RStudio is an *integrated development environment* (IDE). An IDE is like a toolbox. An organized collection of tools for developing content, text, images, video, and code
-   Four panels: Editor, Environment/History, Console/Terminal, Files etc
-   The Quarto markdown source file is shown in the Editor panel. Click on the `Render` button to generate the slides for today's lesson

## What is R?

If Quarto is a car, then RStudio is the dashboard, and R is the engine

![Analogy of difference between R and RStudio](figures/EngineDashboard.png){width="5000"}

## 

-   More precisely, {{< fa brands r-project >}} is a programming language that runs code
-   In a car you have access to a speedometer, rear view mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving easier. RStudio makes using {{< fa brands r-project >}} easier as well
-   In a Quarto markdown file you include code like this
```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

-   When you click the **Render** button a presentation is generated that includes content and the output of embedded code

## Getting to know RStudio and R
