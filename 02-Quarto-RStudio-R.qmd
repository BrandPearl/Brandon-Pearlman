## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source publishing system built on a document converter (Pandoc). When you click on the file `Quarto-RStudio-R.qmd` you should see this ![](figures/RStudio.png){width="500"}

Quarto files begin with a YAML between the lines with the three dashes

## What is RStudio?

* RStudio is an *integrated development environment* (IDE). An IDE is like a toolbox. An organized collection of tools for developing scientific content, text, images, video, executable code

* Four panels: Editor, Environment/History, Console/Terminal, Files etc

* The Quarto markdown source file is shown in the Editor panel. Click on the `Render` button to generate the slides for today's lesson

## What is R?

If Quarto is a car, then RStudio is the dashboard, and R is the engine
