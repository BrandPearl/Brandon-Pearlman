## 

* By graphing data, you gain insights not available by just looking at the data values initially obtain from just looking at the raw data values

* You will use the {ggplot2} package, as it has functions for easily making graphs rooted in the theory known as the grammar of graphics

* A graph is a mapping of variables (columns) in your data frame to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects

* A graph has three components `data`: data frame, `geom`: geometric object like a point or a line, and `aes`: aesthetic attribute like color shape, and size
