## 1 
Write code to download and import the latest greenhouse gas emissions data

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(hockeystick)

emits.df <- hockeystick::get_emissions(write_cache = TRUE)
```

## 2 
Write code to list by country/region the largest emitters of methane in the year 2010

```{r}
emits.df |>
  dplyr::filter(year == 2010) |>
  dplyr::select(country, methane) |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(methane))
```

## 3 
Write code to download and import the latest global air temperature data and make a time series plot of showing July temperatures across the years
```{r}
t.df <- hockeystick::get_temp()

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = t.df,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Jul)) +
  geom_line()
```

## 4
Write code to quantify the increase per year in global temperatures during July

```{r}
lm(Jul ~ Year, data = t.df) # note: this will be per day so need to multiply by 365.25
```
