Climate Change: Day 3
=====================
date: September 2, 2014

Readings: [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/)

For the first exam, read the entire *Highlights* section. In the *Report* section read the subsection entitled *Our Changing Climate* including the *Climate Science Supplement* (PDF).

Term project: **graph and interpret climate change data**. Bellamy 35 computer lab. R/RStudio installed. Email Shawn Lewers (slewers@fsu.edu)

Global Warming is About Heat
============================
Heat is proportional to the kinetic (motion) energy of the molecules.

Energy ~ d/2 x k T, 

where T is temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant and d is the degrees of freedom of the molecule.

### Why is CO2 a greenhouse gas, but not Argon?
Ar (d = 3), O2/N2 (d = 6, 1 vibrational, 2 twisting), CO2 (d = 9)

Insulating thermal pane windows.

Pressure and Temperature
========================
The atmosphere is primarily a mixture of gases. N2, O2, Ar, water vapor, CO2, etc. 
+ The early atmosphere gases included water vapor, CO2, and ammonia (NH3). From where? What happened?

Under pressure: *Why doesn't the sky fall?* 
+ Balance of forces
+ What forces?

Temperature lapse rates.
