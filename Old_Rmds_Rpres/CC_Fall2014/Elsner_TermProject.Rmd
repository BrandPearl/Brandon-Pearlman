### 1. Introduction

Here is where I type a description of my dataset.


### 2. Get the Data

Here is where I show the code used to get the data in R.

```{r}
L = 'http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/data/FLMonthlyT.txt'
df = read.table(L, header = TRUE)
head(df)
```

### 3. Graph the Data

Here is where I show the code used to make a graph of the data. Make sure you label the axes appropriately.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Annual)) +
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Temperature Anomaly (C)")
```

### 4. Draw a Trend Line

Here is where I show the code to add a trend line to the graph.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Annual)) +
  geom_line() + geom_smooth() +
  ylab("Temperature Anomaly (C)")
```

### 5. Describe the Graph

Here is where I write a few sentences describing the graph and trend line.
