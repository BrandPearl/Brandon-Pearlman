1. Introduction

For my project, I was interested to know whether tornadoes are happening more often. I obtain the dataset from Dr. Elsner's web site.

2. Get the Data

```{r}
L = 'http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/data/Tornadoes.txt'
df = read.table(L, header = TRUE)
head(df)
```

3. Graph the Data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
df2 = df %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarize(Count = n())

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df2, aes(x = YEAR, y = Count)) +
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Number of U.S. Tornadoes")
```

4. Draw a Trend Line

```{r}
ggplot(df2, aes(x = YEAR, y = Count)) +
  geom_line() + geom_smooth() +
  ylab("Number of Tornadoes")
```

5. Describe the Graph

The graph shows an upward trend with more tornadoes recently. I think much of the increase is due to better reporting.
