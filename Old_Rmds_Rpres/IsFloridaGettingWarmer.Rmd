Is Florida Getting Warmer?
=========================

Here we look at statewide temperatures in Florida.

Get the data into R.
```{r}
L = 'http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/data/FLMonthlyT.txt'
df = read.table(L, header = TRUE)
```

L is a string locating the data sheet (FLMonthlyT.txt) on a server.
The data is read into R using the read.table function. The first argument to the function is L. The result is a data frame called df. You can use any name you want.

You can click on the df in the Environment panel to bring up the data sheet.

Make a plot of the data.
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Annual)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Annual Temperature (F)")
```

To help us understand whether or not Florida is getting warmer we want to add a trend line through these points.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Annual)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Annual Temperature (F)") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

Challenge: Make a similar plot using the January values.
