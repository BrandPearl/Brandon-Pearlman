## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source publishing system built on a document converter (Pandoc). When you click on the file `Quarto-RStudio-R.qmd` you should see something like ![](figures/RStudio.png){width="500"}

Quarto files begin with a YAML between the two lines each with three dashes.



## What is RStudio?

* RStudio is an *integrated development environment* (IDE). An IDE is like a toolbox. An organized collection of tools for developing scientific content, text, images, video, executable code.

* Four panels: Editor, Environment/History, Console/Terminal, Files etc

* The Quarto markdown source file is shown in the Editor panel. Click on the `Render` button to generate the slides for today's lesson

If Quarto is a car, then RStudio is the dashboard, and R is the engine

More precisely, {{< fa brands r-project >}} is a programming language that runs code

So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rear view mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio's interface makes using {{< fa brands r-project >}} much easier as well.

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation is generated that includes content and the output of embedded code. You embed code like this

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

## Poke around in RStudio
