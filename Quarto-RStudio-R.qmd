## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on a document converter called Pandoc

When you click on the lesson `.qmd` (Quarto markdown) file it opens RStudio. It looks (something) like this


## What are R and RStudio?

If Quarto is a car, then RStudio is the dashboard, and R is the engine

## 

More precisely, R is a programming language that runs code, while RStudio is an *integrated development environment* (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.

So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rear view mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio's interface makes using R much easier as well.

## Using R via RStudio

Just as you don't drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car's dashboard, you won't use R directly but rather you will use RStudio's interface.

After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new programs (applications) you can open. You will always work in RStudio and not in the R application.
