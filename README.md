This course is for students who want to learn more about the relationships between climate change and Earth's most powerful storms through the analysis and modeling of data

All the course slides are available on GitHub

## Class structure

Each class period I will prepare a small set of slides using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Quarto is an open-source scientific publishing system

Quarto allows me to weave together narrative text and code to produce formatted output. Quarto documents are reproducible

The slides (`_.qmd` files) are available on GitHub. The slide files are opened using an application called RStudio

In-person lessons will be held in this room (Bellamy 208)
