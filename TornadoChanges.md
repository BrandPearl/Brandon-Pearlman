Tornado Changes
===============

In this final week of class we examine the evidence for changes in tornado activity.

* The atmosphere seems to becoming more efficient at making tornadoes. So when conditions are right more tornadoes occur.

* It also appears that tornadoes might be getting stronger.

Research on this topic is new.

Are tornadoes getting stronger?
===============================

Problem
=======

* An estimate of how strong a tornado might get in the future requires a continuous scale of intensity.
* The EF damage scale is categorical.
* We can count the number of tornadoes by EF category.
* But a plot of the number of tornadoes by EF category does not answer the question: Are tornadoes getting stronger?

If we solve this problem, then

Studying the damage left behind is the most reliable way to estimate tornado strength. 

But there are other ways. Let's listen to Ian.
