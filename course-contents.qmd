Title: Climate Change & Storms

Theme: Tracking the relationships between a changing climate & storminess with observations

## Getting started

-   Installing R and RStudio
-   Connecting to GitHub
-   Learning to code
-   Generating reports

## Getting climate data

-   Pre-analyzed data
-   CO2 concentration
-   Sea ice and sea levels
-   Temperatures: ocean, land, global vs local
-   Proxy data: ice cores, over-wash sediment deposits, tree rings
-   Humidity
-   Storms: hurricanes, tornadoes
-   Modes of variability

## Analyzing the climate data

-   Statistics vs observations
-   Detection vs attribution
-   Plots and graphs
-   Frequency vs intensity

## Modeling the climate data

-   Regression trends
-   Uncertainty: classical vs Bayesian
-   Space vs time

## Climate models

-   Detection vs attribution
-   Prediction vs predictability
-   Prediction markets

## Take an existing R project and put it on GitHub

"Climate change is an irresistible convenience, for it can be blamed on nobody in particular, and this spares official Florida the burden of its complicity in the larger-scale ruin of the land of our state."--Wendell Berry

How does/might climate change affect X? X: Hurricanes, tornadoes, winter storms, heat waves

## Climate change & storms

Scientists can make the connection between climate change and storms better today than they could only a few years ago

1)  Methodological advances in science of attribution
2)  More years of data means stronger evidence
3)  Physical connections leading to better ways to explain the connections
