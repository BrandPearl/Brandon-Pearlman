## Data on past tropical cyclones

* Where do you find data on past tropical cyclones?
* How do you get the data into a format that you can work with?

##

![Map showing the tracks and intensities of all tropical cyclones over the North Atlantic during the 2019 hurricane season](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tracks/tracks-at-2019.png){#fig-tracks}

##

The National Hurricane Center has data on all tropical cyclones occurring in the North Atlantic and western North Pacific. 

These data are available [here](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/).

## International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTraCS)

Working with the IBTrACS version 4 data set

First you need to

:::{.incremental}
1. Download and unzip the data file
2. Get the data file into R
3. Glimpse contents
:::

:::{.callout-note}
Historical tropical cyclone data from around the world in CSV, netCDF, and shapefiles are available from the International Best-Track Archive for Climate Stewardship. [Here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r00/access)
:::

## Download and unzip the data file

```{r}
#| echo: true
l <- "https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r00/access/shapefile/IBTrACS.NA.list.v04r00.lines.zip"
  
if(!"IBTrACS.NA.list.v04r00.lines.zip" %in% list.files(here::here("data"))) {
download.file(url = l,
              destfile = here::here("data",
                                    "IBTrACS.NA.list.v04r00.lines.zip"))
unzip(here::here("data", "IBTrACS.NA.list.v04r00.lines.zip"),
      exdir = here::here("data"))
}
```

## Get the data file into R

```{r}
#| echo: true
TC.sf <- sf::st_read(dsn = here::here("data"), 
                     layer = "IBTrACS.NA.list.v04r00.lines")
```

## Glimpse the contents {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
TC.sf |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

Each row is a separate three-hourly estimate.

## Hurricane Michael (2018)

Hurricane Michael was a very powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that became the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States since Andrew in 1992.[^1]

[^1]: [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michael).

##

Here you remove all rows from `TC.sf` except those corresponding to Hurricane Michael in 2018.

```{r}
#| echo: true
One.sf <- TC.sf |>
  dplyr::filter(SEASON >= 2018 & NAME == "MICHAEL") |>
  dplyr::select(NAME, USA_WIND)
```

You've removed all rows from `TC.sf` and all columns except `NAME` and `USA_WIND`.

So the new data `One.sf` contains `r nrow(One.sf)` rows and `r ncol(One.sf)` columns.

##

You overlay the track of Hurricane Michael colored by wind speed onto [Leaflet](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/website/leaflet/) map tiles.

```{r}
#| echo: true
tmap::tmap_mode("view")
tmap::tm_shape(One.sf) +
  tmap::tm_lines(col = "USA_WIND", lwd = 3)
```
