## Getting started with data in R

Before you can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first:

1.  What are R and RStudio?
2.  How do I code in R?
3.  What are R packages?

## What are R and RStudio?

R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard.

## 

More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an *integrated development environment* (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.

So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rear view mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio's interface makes using R much easier as well.

## Do this first: Install R

Download and install R by going to <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.

-   If you are a Windows user: Click on *Download R for Windows*, then click on *base*, then click on the *Download* link.

-   If you are macOS user: Click on *Download R for (Mac) OS X*, then under *Latest release:* click on *R-X.X.X.pkg*, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

For example, the latest version of R as of November 18, 2022 was R-4.2.2.

## Do this second: Install RStudio

Download and install RStudio desktop by going to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> *Step 2:*

Scroll down to find your computer's operating system.

## Using R via RStudio

Just as you don't drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car's dashboard, you won't be using R directly but rather you will use RStudio's interface.

After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new programs (applications) you can open. You will always work in RStudio and not in the R application.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```
