## 

* Throughout the semester you'll focus on data that are saved in a “spreadsheet”-type format called a _data frame_

* In a _data frame_ rows are observations and columns are variables

* You start be considering a data frame listing hurricane counts by year in the United States

* <http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/US.txt>

* The data are updated annually. For example, last year there was hurricane's Ian and Nicole hit Florida

##

```{r}
#| echo: true
L <- "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/US.txt"
LH.df <- readr::read_table(file = L)

LH.df |>
  head()
```
